# Oro Theme

Made to be aesthetically pleasing while keeping a good amount of visual
distinction between different elements all the same.

Feel free to try it out for yourself and see if you like it.

## Contributing

If you find anything that looks wrong (e.g. a type being colored as if it was
a function), or if you have an idea for an improvement or a new theme variant,
please do let me know by [opening an issue][issue]. I'll look into it as soon
as possible.

## Extra

- The font used in the screenshot is [Victor Mono][victor-mono].

- The `<- #⁠13-18 trait MyTrait` comes from the [Bracket Lens][bracket-lens]
  extension.

- The diagnostic messages (`rusc: use of deprecated ...`) comes from the
  [Error Lens][error-lens] extension.
