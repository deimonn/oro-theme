# Oro Dark Theme

This is a small theme I made for personal use. It was made to be aesthetically
pleasing while keeping a good amount of visual distinction between different
elements all the same.

Feel free to try it out for yourself and see if you like it.

I've mainly tested it with statically typed languages like Rust, C++ and C#; I
only minimally tested it on other languages such as Python and TypeScript, so
coloring there *could* be a little skewed.

If you find anything that looks wrong (e.g. a type being colored as if it was
a function), feel free to let me know. I will fix it as soon as possible.
