Dark mode theme designed to be aesthetically pleasing while keeping a good amount of visual distinction between different elements all the same.

The theme also comes packed with features! Its not just about colors.

## Features

### Support for semantic tokens & modifiers!

The theme provides semantic highlighting out-of-the-box, with built-in support for popular language servers like [Pylance], [rust-analyzer] and [clangd] so that nothing looks off.

It also uniquely styles various common semantic modifiers:

Deprecation (strikethrough) | Mutable/mutated (underline) | Consuming (bold)
--                          | --                          | --

[clangd]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd

### *Very* obvious diagnostics!

Oro Theme adds background coloring and an extra underline to error, warning and info diagnostics so that they are extra visible in code by default:

Error | Warning | Info

### Built-in support for [Error Lens]!

If you have [Error Lens] installed, Oro Theme will also apply its diagnostic styling to it as well, so everything looks consistent:

### ...And various other miscellaneous features!

The theme is being constantly updated as I use it in my day to day. Just check out the changelog to see how much it has progressed since its early days!

## Variants

There's currently only two variants; the default and an italics version. More theme variants may be added in the future.
