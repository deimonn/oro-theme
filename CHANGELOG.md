## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Improved markup styling; markdown is unchanged, but other markup formats
  should see better coloring now
- Improved macro coloring; now they will also be colored via syntax
  highlighting, not just semantic

## [1.2.0] - 2023-10-25

### Added

- Added support for Pylance-specific semantic highlighting
  - Special parameters `self` and `cls` are now colored as keywords
  - Language constants such as `True` and `False` are now colored as expected

### Changed

  settings or extension descriptions) to distinguish it from links

## [1.1.0] - 2023-08-18

### Fixed

- Extension no longer ships the screenshot source with it

## [1.0.2] - 2023-07-22
